                What is JavaScript?
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. </p>
            <p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run
                automatically as the page loads. </p>
            <p>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to
                run.
            </p>
            <p>Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device
                that has a special program called the JavaScript engine. </p>
            <p>The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”. </p>
            <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>V8 – in Chrome and Opera. </li>
                <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox. </li>
                <li>…There are other codenames like “Trident” and “Chakra” for different versions of IE, “ChakraCore”
                    for Microsoft Edge, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll
                use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome and
                Opera.

            <header>
                Declaring a variable
            </header>
            <p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable.
                To do this, we type the keyword var or let followed by the name you want to call your variable:
            </p>
            <pre>
               <code>
    let myName;
    let myAge; </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge. Try typing these lines into your web browser's
                console. After that, try creating a variable (or two) with your own name choices.
            </p>

            <p>You can test whether these values now exist in the execution environment by typing just the variable's
                name, e.g.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    myName;
    myAge;</code>
            </pre>
            <p>They currently have no value; they are empty containers. When you enter the variable names, you should
                get a value of undefined returned. If they don't exist, you'll get an error message — try typing in
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    scoobyDoo;</code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Initializing_a_variable">
            <header>
                Initializing a variable
            </header>
            <p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable
                name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    myName = 'Chris';
    myAge = 37;</code>
            </pre>
            <p>Try going back to the console now and typing in these lines. You should see the value you've assigned to
                the variable returned in the console to confirm it, in each case. Again, you can return your variable
                values by simply typing their name into the console — try these again:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    myName;
    myAge;</code>
            </pre>
            <p> You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this: </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    let myDog = 'Rover';</code>
            </pre>
            <p>This is probably what you'll do most of the time, as it is quicker than doing the two actions on two
                separate lines.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_naming_rules">
            <header>
                Variable naming rules
            </header>
            <p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should
                stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an
                    international audience.
                </li>
                <li>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs
                    to mean specific things, so may get confusing.
                </li>
                <li>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.
                </li>
                <li>A safe convention to stick to is so-called "lower camel case", where you stick together multiple
                    words, using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been
                    using this for our variable names in the article so far.
                </li>
                <li>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single
                    letters/numbers, or big long phrases.
                </li>
                <li>Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable from myAge.
                </li>
                <li>One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by
                    this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like
                    var, function, let, and for as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and
                    so you'll get errors.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Dynamic_Typing">
            <header>
                Dynamic typing
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't
                need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc).
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in quotes, the browser treats the
                variable as a string:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    let myString = 'Hello';</code> 

            </pre>
            <p>Even if the value contains numbers, it is still a string, so be careful:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    let myNumber = '500'; // oops, this is still a string
    typeof myNumber;
    myNumber = 500; // much better — now this is a number
    typeof myNumber;</code>
            </pre>
            <p>Try entering the four lines above into your console one by one, and see what the results are. You'll
                notice that we are using a special operator called typeof — this returns the data type of the variable
                you type after it. The first time it is called, it should return string, as at that point the myNumber
                variable contains a string, '500'. Have a look and see what it returns the second time you call it.

            </p>
